🛡 ChurnShield AI
An Intelligent Customer Retention System powered by XGBoost & Streamlit.

📌 Problem Statement
Businesses lose significant revenue due to customer churn, often realizing it too late. Existing solutions are reactive, not proactive. ChurnShield AI predicts which customers are likely to leave and why, enabling support teams to intervene with targeted retention strategies.

💡 The Solution
ChurnShield is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that:

Cleans "Messy" Data: Handles inconsistent formatting and missing values automatically.

Identifies At-Risk Users: Uses XGBoost trained on behavioral patterns (Usage, Complaints, Transactions).

Handles Imbalance: Implements SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling) to accurately detect the minority class (Churners).

Provides Actionable Intelligence: A Streamlit Dashboard visualizes risk scores and recommends specific business actions.
